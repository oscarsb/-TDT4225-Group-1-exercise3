# -TDT4225-Group-1-exercise3

To run the database: 
1. ssh 'username'@tdt4225-01.idi.ntnu.no
2. sudo mongod --bind_ip_all\
       If successful, you have now 
       a running MongoDB-server (the bind_ip_all flag opens for connections from any 
       IP-address, but don’t worry, we’ll use authentication). This server must be 
       running whenever you are working with the task. Only one of the group 
       members has to run the server at a time.
